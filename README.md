# DPLL SAT Solver with Conflict-Driven Clause Learning

This project implements a **SAT solver** using the **DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) algorithm**, enhanced with **Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL)**. The solver checks if a formula in Conjunctive Normal Form(CNF) is satisfiable, and prints a satisfying assignment if possible. The solver is built using an object-oriented approach and includes three primary classes: `Literal`, `Clause`, and `Solver`.

## Features

- **DPLL Algorithm**: Implements the core DPLL procedure for satisfiability checking.
- **Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL)**: Enhances the DPLL algorithm by learning new clauses during conflicts to reduce the search space.
- **Literal Class**: Manages individual literals and their assignments.
- **Clause Class**: Represents clauses and provides methods to manage and evaluate them.
- **Solver Class**: Executes the SAT-solving process, tracks decision levels, and implements clause learning.

## Usage

Compile the project using your preferred C++ compiler with C++ standard 20. For example:
```bash
g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp -o solver 
```

Run the program interactively by providing inputs directly from the command line when prompted.
